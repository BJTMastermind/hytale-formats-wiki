# Hytale 2026.02.17-255364b8e (Update 3)

**2026.02.17-255364b8e** is a major update for Hytale released on February 17th, 2026[\[1\]](#1), which adds animal taming, localization, avatar presets, grass spreading, and more!

---

Hytale's 3rd update is here, four weeks into Early Access! Our release rhythm going forward: weekly pre-release patches for testing, bundled into a stable update every 2 to 6 weeks once things feel solid.

Beyond regular updates, we're building chapters, larger content drops that unfold the Cursebreaker arc in Exploration Mode. We won't spoil the story, but here's the shape of it: the Cursebreaker arc is how Hytale progresses through Early Access, chapter by chapter, until the final chapter puts Orbis within reach and we step into full release.

We've been growing the team, and we're proud to say that several hires have come straight from the modding community! Thank you for your support, your feedback, and for being here from the start!

## Headline Features
