# Level format

Each level is its own folder. A level folder is often identified by having a ??? file, along with other subfolders to store the maps and regions of the level.

## Directory structure

This is the directory structure of the `Hytale/worlds` folder, where the game saves the entire world data:

<div markdown="1" id="treeview">

* : A world directory.
{.addicon .file_system.directory}
    * TBD
    {.addicon .file_system.file .file_system.directory}

</div>

## History

<table id="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="8"><p>Early Access</p></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>0.0.0</th>
            <td>To Be Determined</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
